            SOC-NET Fusion / Vetting Platform
        </h1>

<h3>The Need</h3>

<ul>
<li>SOC-NET members have already requested the capacity to vet / confirm early
    threat reports or developing incident information (bombing, shooting, other
    disruptive events) where members of the community can share a report and
its source for others to validate / augment / dispute optimally from alternate
sources.</li>
<li>SOC-NET members have also indicated that they would like to increase the
    sharing of wider global events having primarily focused most recently on
    the metro-New York area.</li>
<li>If vetting is sought for multiple threats and events across the globe on a
    regular basis, the current email distribution approach for SOC-NET members
    may result in substantial volumes of information in personal inboxes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Potential Response </h3>
<ul>
<li>A real time repository / platform versus simple e-mail traffic as a means
    of vetting uncertain information.</li>
<li>Primary users would be on-duty analysts versus administrative contacts but
    all would have access</li>
<li>SOC-NET members could send incident-related information to via e-mail /
    text or enter directly on the platform.</li>
<li>Could be an online dashboard that analysts could keep opened at all times
    or only during events.</li>
<li>Could be organized automatically along various categories or threads based
    on geography / location or type of event.</li>
<li>Members won&rsquo;t get barraged with e-mails in their personal inboxes.</li>
<li>There could be one email at the start of an open incident with a link to the platform

<ul>
<li>Users could sign up for alerts for particular countries / cities only</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Reports could utilize a standard format / tags that an algorithm can easily recognize

<ul>
<li>SUBJECT: &ldquo;[Incident Type] - [City], [Country],&rdquo; ex.
    &ldquo;Vehicle Ramming &ndash; Paris, France&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Vetting / Validating Aspect: Could have buttons along the lines of
    &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen this too&rdquo; &ldquo;I can confirm this&rdquo; or
    &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen conflicting information&rdquo; that members can
click, show a percentage of each or color-code the item based on if it&rsquo;s
mostly agreed-upon or not
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Possible Questions for SOC-NET Members</h3>
<p>What do you currently use for information validation?
</p>
    
<ul>
<li>E-mail lists</li>
<li>Phone calls</li>
<li>News media</li>
<li>Social media</li>
<li>Online platform (name?)</li>
<li>Other</li>
</ul>


<p>
What is the most important information to validate during an event?
</p>

<ul>
<li>Exact location</li>
<li>Exact time of event</li>
<li>Description of Event Impacts, e.g., related street / transportation closures</li>
<li>Evacuations / shelter in place orders</li>
</ul>

<p>
Other questions:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Question about timeliness?</li>
<li>[Describe the new platform] &ndash; would this be helpful?</li>
<li>What additional features would you like to see?</li>
<li>What potential issues / challenges do you see?</li>
</ul>
