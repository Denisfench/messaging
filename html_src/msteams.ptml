            Review of Microsoft Teams Interoperability Characteristics
        </h1>

    <p><strong>This document answers some basic questions about Microsoft Teams
        for creating custom GET/POST APIs</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. How can we achieve calling (custom GET/POST)APIs?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Although I'm not sure if this counts as a custom GET/POST API, we can
    create Connector Cards,
which seem like interactive messages (eg. Invites, Weather, Calender events?
Not sure)
to an Office 365 group using an API Client to send a POST request. The
recommended client is Postman. </li>

<li>We can also make custom webhooks using Connectors, MS Teams' interface for
    webhooks and 3rd party apps, as described . This interface is also
used to make the previously mentioned Connector Cards. </li>

<li>Although there are other uses for these connectors such as notifying users
    of an upcoming meeting, scheduling dates and
deadlines, sending files or approving budget changes, I believe the focus of
SOCNET is to send messages,
specifically to warn people of an emergency in their area, and Adaptive Cards
(Previously referred to as Connector Cards)
look to be the most ideal way of achieving this. If you look in the 5th
reference, you can enter a sandbox with various adaptive
card templates, and you should be able to understand what the limits of these
cards are. You can use these Adaptive Cards to
message a channel, and collect input based on what we need, such as  "Can you
see the emergency (Storm/Tornado/etc) from your
location", "Is your location in a shelter or a building that can resist the
disaster?", etc. This data can then be used to
improve our messages. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. What resources are required for connecting with MSTeams?
</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is required at least:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A text/json editor to create the JSON payload.</li>
<li>A way to send the JSON as a POST i.e cURL, API Client, Powershell</li>
<li>A MS Teams Webhook URL, created in the Connectors menu of MS Teams. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. Are there any standards surrounding the product that we have to
    follow?</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Other then what is needed for the requirements or listed in required, none
    that I could find.</li>
</ul>
