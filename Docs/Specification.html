<p><strong>SOC-NET Fusion / Vetting Platform</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Need</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>SOC-NET members have already requested the capacity to vet / confirm early threat reports or developing incident information (bombing, shooting, other disruptive events) where members of the community can share a report and its source for others to validate / augment / dispute optimally from alternate sources.</li>
<li>SOC-NET members have also indicated that they would like to increase the sharing of wider global events having primarily focused most recently on the metro-New York area.</li>
<li>If vetting is sought for multiple threats and events across the globe on a regular basis, the current email distribution approach for SOC-NET members may result in substantial volumes of information in personal inboxes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Potential Response </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A real time repository / platform versus simple e-mail traffic as a means of vetting uncertain information.</li>
<li>Primary users would be on-duty analysts versus administrative contacts but all would have access</li>
<li>SOC-NET members could send incident-related information to via e-mail / text or enter directly on the platform.</li>
<li>Could be an online dashboard that analysts could keep opened at all times or only during events.</li>
<li>Could be organized automatically along various categories or threads based on geography / location or type of event.</li>
<li>Members won&rsquo;t get barraged with e-mails in their personal inboxes.</li>
<li>There could be one email at the start of an open incident with a link to the platform
<ul>
<li>Users could sign up for alerts for particular countries / cities only</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reports could utilize a standard format / tags that an algorithm can easily recognize
<ul>
<li>SUBJECT: &ldquo;[Incident Type] - [City], [Country],&rdquo; ex. &ldquo;Vehicle Ramming &ndash; Paris, France&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Vetting / Validating Aspect: Could have buttons along the lines of &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen this too&rdquo; &ldquo;I can confirm this&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen conflicting information&rdquo; that members can click, show a percentage of each or color-code the item based on if it&rsquo;s mostly agreed-upon or not</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Possible Questions for SOC-NET Members</strong></p>
<ul>
