            Review of Telegram Interoperability Characteristics
        </h1>

<p><strong>This document answers some basic questions about Telegram for creating custom GET/POST APIs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>we can create custom GET/POST APIs in telegram that users can interact with.</li>
<li>Telegram allows developers to create bots. Bots are third-party applications that run inside Telegram. </li>
<li>Users can interact with bots by sending them messages, commands and inline requests.</li>
<li>Telegram Bot API provides a HTTP-based interface for developers keen on building bots for Telegram.</li>
<li>A detailed documentation on how to create a bot for telegram can be found here (<a href=https://core.telegram.org/bots>https://core.telegram.org/bots</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1. How can we achieve calling (custom GET/POST)APIs?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Messages, commands and requests sent by users are passed to the software running on our servers. </li>
<li>Telegram's intermediary server handles all encryption and communication with the Telegram API for us. </li>
<li>we communicate with this server via a simple HTTPS-interface that offers a simplified version of the Telegram API. </li>
<li>that interface is called Bot API. (<a href=https://core.telegram.org/bots/api>https://core.telegram.org/bots/api</a>)</li>
<li>Bot API supports GET and POST HTTP methods. there are four ways of passing parameters in Bot API requests:</li>
<li>1) URL query string</li>
<li>2) application/x-www-form-urlencoded</li>
<li>3) application/json (except for uploading files)</li>
<li>4) multipart/form-data (use to upload files)</li>

<li>We can also design a custom app using TDLib (Telegram Database Library), a cross-platform, fully functional Telegram client. </li>
<li>It is designed to help third-party developers create their own custom apps using the Telegram platform.</li>
<li>creating a custom client is not necessary but can be considered if we want to provide an alternate way to communicate with our bot.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. What resources are required for producing or providing it?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Our bot has to continously pull updates from the Telegram server using one of the methods described below.</li>
<li>we will receive JSON-serialized Update objects as a result.</li>
<li>There are two mutually exclusive ways of receiving updates for our bot:</li>
<li>1) the getUpdates method (<a href=https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#getupdates>https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#getupdates</a>)</li>
<li>2) Webhooks (<a href=https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#setwebhook>https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#setwebhook</a>)</li>
<li>Incoming updates are stored on the telegram server until the bot receives them either way.</li>
<li>The messages are stored on telegram server for 24 hours max.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Are there any standards surrounding the product that we have to follow?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>At a higher level we need to take care of user authorization and message encription.</li>
<li>Telegram follows MTProto Mobile Protocol a detailed description can be found here: <a href=https://core.telegram.org/mtproto>https://core.telegram.org/mtproto</a></li>
<li>If we decide to develop a client application we need to comply with the security guidelines found here: <a href=https://core.telegram.org/mtproto/security_guidelines>https://core.telegram.org/mtproto/security_guidelines</a></li>
</ul>
