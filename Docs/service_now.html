            Review of ServiceNow Interoperability Characteristics
        </h1>
<p><strong>This document answers some basic questions about ServiceNow for creating custom GET/POST APIs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>ServiceNow provides REST APIs that allow us to interact with an instance remotely using REST requests. 
    we can create, read, update, and delete records as well as access specialized APIs such as the Import Set and Attachment APIs. 
    REST APIs support standard platform functionality for working with data, such as role-based permissions.
</li>
<li>
    In addition to the APIs provided by ServiceNow we can create custom REST APIs using the scripted REST APIs feature.
    The scripted REST API feature allows application developers to build custom web service APIs.
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1. How can we achieve calling (custom GET/POST)APIs?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
    we can call the default/custom REST APIs by hitting the endpoint and passing the required parameters along with user credentials.
</li>
<li>ServiceNow provides extensive access to instances through a set of RESTful APIs. 
    a detailed description of all the available endpoints can be found here: <a href=https://developer.servicenow.com/app.do#!/rest_api_doc?v=madrid&id=r_TableAPI-GET>https://developer.servicenow.com/app.do#!/rest_api_doc?v=madrid&id=r_TableAPI-GET</a>
</li>
<li>
    ServiceNow REST APIs support Basic Authentication and OAuth 2.0 to authenticate requests.
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. What resources are required for producing or providing it?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We should have correct level of access on the platform to be able to create custom REST APIs.</li>
<li>The REST APIs provided by ServiceNow are available out of the box.</li>
<li>To create custom REST APIs we can leverage the scripted REST API feature.
    we can define service endpoints, query parameters, and headers for a scripted REST API, as well as scripts to manage the request and response.
    Scripted REST APIs generally follow the REST architecture, but you can customize them to use different conventions.
    A detailed description can be found <a href=https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/newyork-application-development/page/integrate/custom-web-services/concept/c_CustomWebServices.html>here</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Are there any standards surrounding the product that we have to follow?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There are a few best practices that can be followed when developing REST APIs with ServiceNow. Detailed documentation can be found <a href=https://developer.servicenow.com/app.do#!/catlist/technical_best_practices?v=newyork>here</a>.</li>
